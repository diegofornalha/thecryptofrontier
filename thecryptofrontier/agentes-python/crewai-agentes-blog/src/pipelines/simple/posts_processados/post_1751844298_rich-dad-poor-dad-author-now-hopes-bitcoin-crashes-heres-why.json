  "summary": "<b>Financial author Robert Kiyosaki has warned of attention-seeking “losers” who are increasingly speculating that Bitcoin will crash but hope it happens.</b>\n\nKiyosaki warned that these growing assertions are misleading and aim to sway speculators from reaping the rewards of buying Bitcoin. He shared these claims in a July 5 <a href=\"https://x.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1941290425580650990\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tweet</a> as Bitcoin retraces slightly from its intra-week high of $110,600.\nClickbait Losers Keep Speculating About a Bitcoin Crash\nWhile Bitcoin has shown resilience, speculations that a crash is on the horizon are making the rounds. Specifically, some believe that Bitcoin has reached its peak for the cycle and could undergo a significant correction in the near term.\n\nNonetheless, Kiyosaki insists these are exaggerated claims. He emphasized that those making these assertions are individuals and media outlets seeking attention through clickbait headlines.\n\nFurthermore, he noted that these speculations only frighten speculators or short-term investors. Notably, projections of a crash like this manipulate market sentiments, preventing retail from entering the market.\nKiyosaki Shares What He Will Do If  Bitcoin Crashes\nMeanwhile, if Bitcoin eventually crashes, Kiyosaki shared that he would buy more. His unperturbed disposition comes from a long-term bullish view of the pioneering cryptocurrency.\n\nIn fact, he stated that he hopes Bitcoin drops. According to him, the event would give him the opportunity to buy more BTC at a reduced price in anticipation of its rebound to unprecedented levels in the future.\n\nRemarkably, this highlights that Kiyosaki views Bitcoin as an asset with a bullish long-term trajectory, influencing his perspective beyond its short-term price action. This aligns with <a href=\"https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/30/michael-saylor-says-bitcoin-has-90-success-rate-in-5-years-and-99-in-30-40-years/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Saylor’s </a>call that those who hold Bitcoin for at least five years have a significant chance of success.\n\nInterestingly, Kiyosaki is not waiting for a crash before he buys Bitcoin.

This is because he believes Bitcoin is undervalued at the current price and would reach $200,000 by the end of the year and $1 million in the next five years.\n\nMoreover, his recent tweet further spotlights his long-standing support for Bitcoin as a better alternative to saving in fiat currencies.
