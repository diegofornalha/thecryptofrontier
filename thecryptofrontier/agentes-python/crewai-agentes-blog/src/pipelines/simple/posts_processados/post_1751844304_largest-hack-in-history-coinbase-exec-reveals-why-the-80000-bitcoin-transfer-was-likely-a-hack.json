Notably, Lookonchain confirmed that it was a Bitcoin OG who was moving his stash.\n\nAbout 8 wallets were tied to the whale, each containing 10,000 BTC. Particularly, the whale moved all bitcoins to 8 new addresses, which still hold the stash at the time of writing.\n\nNonetheless, Grogan highlighted a few reasons why the move might not have come from the account’s original owner. For one, the Coinbase exec said he discovered a singular test transaction on the Bitcoin Cash network from one of the whales, followed by the full amount.\n\nThis meant that the transaction was to test the private keys quietly on the BCH network, which attracted less attention than on <a href=\"https://thecryptobasic.com/tag/bitcoin/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin</a>. Further details reveal that the test transaction involved 10,000 BCH, worth approximately $4.9 million at the time.\n\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 2626px;\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1544\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GvB1v2RWoAAggYK?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096\" width=\"2626\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Receipt Of Test Transaction</figcaption></figure>\n\nAfter a successful test, the whale moved its first 10,000 BTC ($1.09 billion) from the “12tLs9” before shifting from all other 7 wallets linked to the owner, totaling 80,009 BTC ($8.6 billion).\nGrogan Highlights Strange Move\nMoreover, Grogan shared that the other BCH wallets affiliated with the BTC whale remain untouched, aside from the one involved in the test transaction. As a result, he questioned why the owner had not moved them if his intention was simply to relocate his Bitcoin stash to new addresses.\n\nGrogan ruled out the possibility it was an exchange wallet or an institution moving their stash due to the BCH test transaction. He also highlighted that the whale moved the stash manually, further suggesting it was an individual.\n\nNonetheless, he stressed that he was “speculating on straws here” and had not confirmed his suspicions.
