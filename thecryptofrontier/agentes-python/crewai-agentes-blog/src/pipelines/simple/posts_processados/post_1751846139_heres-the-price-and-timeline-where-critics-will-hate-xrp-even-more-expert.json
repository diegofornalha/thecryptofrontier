This comes after XRPL co-founder Arthur Britto <a href=\"https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/24/xrpl-founder-who-predicted-xrp-to-10000-tweets-after-13-years-silence/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">broke</a> his 13-year silence on X last month, posting a single emoji. \n\nAs reported earlier, Britto’s sudden reappearance on X sparked reactions among members of the XRP community.

Cobb’s commentary is a clever way of saying people trash-talking XRP at the moment might regret doing so if its price rallies to $15 by December 2025. \nPath to $15 \nThe projected $15 target represents a 581% increase from the current price of $ 2.20. Hitting this target would mark a new all-time high for XRP, surpassing the previous $3.84 record set in January 2018 by 290.62%. \n\nThe impact of this surge will be tremendous for early investors.
