  "summary": "<strong>An XRP community figure has analyzed how just 1,000 XRP tokens could be worth millions in the future, when factoring in XRP's full potential.</strong>\nXRP Remains Undervalued at $2\nNotably, XRP has held steady around the $2 range, but many crypto analysts believe the token still <a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/20/dag-md-says-xrp-is-heavily-undervalued-could-see-massive-upside-if-it-handles-just-10-of-swifts-daily-transactions/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">trades far below its true worth</a>. Their argument centers on XRP's growing utility, especially in global payments. \n\nAs a result, some community analysts have begun estimating just how high XRP's price could climb once the market fully recognizes its potential.\n\nThe latest of these estimations came from The5Blairs, a community figure. In a recent <a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://x.com/the5blairs/status/1939000348850692187\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">commentary</a>, The5Blairs explained how XRP, at its current price of $2.20 and with 60 billion tokens in circulation, could handle about $1.3 trillion in yearly on-chain volume. \n\nFor context, the calculation uses an annual velocity of 10. Notably, annual velocity refers to how often each token moves through the system each year. The analyst then went on to highlight several factors that could propel XRP to this height.\nFactors That Could Push XRP Price Upward\nFirst, he pointed to <a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/08/19/ripple-business-dealings-show-1700-signed-contracts-for-xrp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ripple's 1,700 signed non-disclosure agreements</a> with banks, tech companies, and payment platforms. Importantly, these NDAs, revealed through court documents during Ripple's legal fight with the SEC, show just how deeply Ripple has engaged with institutions exploring XRP's use.\n\nIn addition, The5Blairs highlighted a recent comment from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Last month, <a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/12/heres-xrp-price-if-xrpl-handles-14-of-swift-volume-as-projected-by-ripple-ceo/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Garlinghouse predicted</a> that XRP could process up to 14% of SWIFT's total volume within five years. \n\nFor context, SWIFT, the dominant global financial messaging network, currently routes about $150 trillion each year. If XRP handles 15% of this volume, it could be on track to move over $20 trillion annually just from that channel. However, it doesn't stop there.\n\nThe5Blairs also pointed to <a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/29/heres-what-xrp-could-be-worth-if-xrpl-captures-10-of-1-quadrillion-derivatives-market/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">XRP's potential</a> to capture a portion of the derivatives market. Notably, the global derivatives market sits at around $1 quadrillion, and Ripple aims to tap into that as well. \n\nAlso, the DTCC, one of the largest clearing and settlement firms in the world, which processes over $2 quadrillion each year, <a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20250078162A1/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently included</a> Ripple and XRP in patent filings related to cross-chain settlement systems. Some believe this could be a sign of a potential integration, but this remains speculative.\nHow 1,000 XRP Could be Worth $3.38M\nTaking all this into account, The5Blairs projected that XRP might handle between $100 trillion and $2 quadrillion in annual transaction flow in the coming years. Specifically, this is 1,538 times more than it currently processes. \n\nNow, if the circulating supply and velocity stay the same, then <a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/05/heres-xrp-price-if-bitcoin-hits-1m-and-xrp-maintains-its-market-share/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">XRP's price</a> would need to grow by the same multiple to support the increased volume. At 1,538 times its current $2.20 value, XRP would trade at $3,380.\n\nThis price change would drastically change the future of anyone holding XRP today. For instance, someone with 1,000 XRP, now worth $2,200, would see their stack turn into $3.38 million. Meanwhile, a holder with 5,000 XRP would sit on $16.9 million. Those who own 10,000 XRP would see $33.8 million, and a 50,000 XRP wallet would be worth a staggering $169 million.",
