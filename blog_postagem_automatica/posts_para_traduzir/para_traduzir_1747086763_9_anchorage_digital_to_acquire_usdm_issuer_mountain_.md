"With recent regulatory progress and new institutional use cases, our long-term vision is clear: every business will be a stablecoin business."</p><p>"By acquiring Mountain Protocol, we are taking a significant step forward in supporting institutional stablecoin adoption and advancing a new era of safety, security, and regulatory compliance in the global digital asset ecosystem," McCauley added.</p><p>The move comes as the stablecoin adoption is soaring, with payment firms, fintechs and even banks eyeing the asset class with legislation looming in the U.S. to regulate. These cryptocurrencies are anchored to an external asset, predominantly to the U.S dollar, and offer a cheaper, faster alternative to traditional payment rails with programmable transfer and .
