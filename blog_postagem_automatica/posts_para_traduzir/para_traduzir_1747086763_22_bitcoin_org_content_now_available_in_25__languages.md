<h2 id="bitcoin-is-spreading">Bitcoin is Spreading</h2>

<p class="center"><img alt="Bitcoin.org Now Available in 25+ Languages" src="https://bitcoin.org/img/blog/free/site-now-available-in-25-plus-languages.gif?1746155269" /></p>

<p>Over the the past year, as part of Bitcoin.org’s ongoing content translation
initiative to help spread information about Bitcoin all around the world, many
people have helped extend and update the site into their own native languages.</p>

<p>Thanks to community donations and a <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/new-supporting-sponsorship-from-paxful">sponsorship from Paxful</a>,
translators throughout 2018 received bitcoin bonuses in appreciation
for the time and efforts that they had spent volunteering. Bitcoin.org content
is available in 25+ languages including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arabic</li>
  <li>Bulgarian</li>
  <li>Danish</li>
  <li>Dutch</li>
  <li>English</li>
  <li>Farsi</li>
  <li>French</li>
  <li>German</li>
  <li>Greek</li>
  <li>Hindi</li>
  <li>Hungarian</li>
  <li>Indonesian</li>
  <li>Italian</li>
  <li>Japanese</li>
  <li>Korean</li>
  <li>Mandarin</li>
  <li>Polish</li>
  <li>Portuguese (Brazilian)</li>
  <li>Romanian</li>
  <li>Russian</li>
  <li>Serbian</li>
  <li>Slovenian</li>
  <li>Spanish</li>
  <li>Swedish</li>
  <li>Turkish</li>
</ul>

<p>As the original website domain registered by Satoshi Nakamoto in association
with the technology, and one of the first results people encounter when
searching the web for more information about Bitcoin, this accomplishment
enables billions of people to potentially learn more about it and how to get
started using it as easily as possible. Also, despite being a privately owned
site, Bitcoin.org’s code is <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/">open-source</a>.
There have been thousands of commits and contributions from hundreds of
contributors and translators. The open source nature by which the site is run,
helps to ensure that new users are still able to find unbiased and qualitative
information about Bitcoin, to make their own informed decisions about which
products and services might be the optimal choice for them to use.</p>

<p>In 2019, translation coverage will continue to expand across the site into areas
where translated content previously wasn’t available, areas such as the developer
documentation, for example.</p>

<p>If you speak English and another language and would like to help spread the word
about Bitcoin, <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/how-to-help-translate">it’s easy to get started</a>!</p>

<p>Thanks goes to everyone who contributes to make this possible.</p>
