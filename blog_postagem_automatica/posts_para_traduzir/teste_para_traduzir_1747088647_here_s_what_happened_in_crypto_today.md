Global crypto funds continued to see strong inflows, pushing total assets to $169 billion. Meanwhile, traders are closely watching Bitcoin price moves following news of trade progress between the US and China.<h2>SEC Chair: Blockchain 'holds promise' of new kinds of market activity</h2><p>Blockchain technology <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-chair-blockchain-holds-promise-new-kinds-market-activity" rel="" target="_self" title="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-chair-blockchain-holds-promise-new-kinds-market-activity">could enable &ldquo;a broad swath of novel use cases for securities&rdquo;</a> and foster &ldquo;new kinds of market activities that many of the Commission&rsquo;s legacy rules and regulations do not contemplate today,&rdquo; Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-crypto-roundtable-tokenization-051225" rel="null" target="null" title="null">said</a>.</p><p>During his keynote address at the Commission&rsquo;s May 12 roundtable on tokenization and digital assets, Atkins welcomed &ldquo;a new day at the SEC,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;policymaking will no longer result from ad hoc enforcement actions. Instead, the Commission will utilize its existing rulemaking, interpretive, and exemptive authorities to set fit-for-purpose standards for market participants.&rdquo;</p><figure><img alt="Cryptocurrencies, Law, China, Bitcoin Price, Investments, Economy, US Government, United States, Donald Trump, Bitcoin SV, CoinShares, Ethereum ETF, Bitcoin ETF, ETF" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c657-f95e-7e14-9afc-7c76280a4122" title="" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>Source:&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/SECGov/status/1922001049595863129" rel="null" target="null" title="https://x.com/SECGov/status/1922001049595863129"><em>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>A key priority will be to &ldquo;develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to discourage bad actors from violating the law.&rdquo;</p><p>In particular, Atkins said the SEC would focus on establishing &ldquo;clear and sensible guidelines&rdquo; for crypto assets that could be considered securities. Another area of focus would be to allow brokers to offer a broader range of investment products on their platforms, which in some cases may mix securities and non-securities.</p><p>Atkins&rsquo; approach moves away from former SEC Chair Gary Gensler&rsquo;s, whose tenure was criticized by some industry participants for its <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-enforcement-actions-gary-gensler" rel="null" target="null" title="null">&ldquo;regulation by enforcement&rdquo;</a> method of oversight.</p><h2>US crypto funds smash old record amid four-week inflow streak</h2><p>Cryptocurrency investment products <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-crypto-etfs-smash-new-record-amid-4-week-inflow-streak" rel="" target="_self" title="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-crypto-etfs-smash-new-record-amid-4-week-inflow-streak">continued receiving healthy inflows</a> last week, attracting $882 million as global crypto funds approached all-time high asset levels.</p><p>Global crypto <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/etp-vs-etf" rel="null" target="null" title="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/etp-vs-etf">exchange-traded products (ETPs</a>) recorded $6.3 billion of inflows in the past four weeks, accounting for 93% of total inflows year-to-date (YTD), according to data from European crypto investment firm CoinShares.</p><p>Total YTD inflows now stand at $6.7 billion, closing in on the record $7.3 billion posted in early February, <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-233-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-f38946027bd6" rel="null" target="null" title="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-233-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-f38946027bd6">according</a> to CoinShares&rsquo; head of research James Butterfill.</p><figure><img alt="Here&rsquo;s what happened in crypto today" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c4c2-a595-7413-b06f-2b6051f496bb" title="" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>Weekly crypto ETP inflows since late 2024.
