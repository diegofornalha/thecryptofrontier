Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict. This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-china-tariff-truce-crypto-market-rally" rel="null" target="null" title="null">seemed like positive</a> developments.</p><p>The 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue. According to Yahoo Finance, the topics under <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-and-china-to-slash-tariffs-for-90-days-as-trump-and-xi-likely-to-talk-maybe-at-the-end-of-the-week-101943792.html" rel="null" target="null" title="null">discussion</a> include &ldquo;currency manipulation,&rdquo; &ldquo;steel price dumping,&rdquo; and restrictions on semiconductor exports.</p><figure><img alt="Bitcoin price sells off after Trump&rsquo;s US-China tariff deal &mdash; Here is why" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c603-beea-72cf-812b-e7d33a544ebc" title="" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>Bitcoin/USD (orange) vs. S&amp;P 500 futures (red) and gold (blue). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph</em></figcaption></figure><p>Part of Bitcoin&rsquo;s recent lack of momentum can be attributed to its 24% gains over the previous 30 days, during which S&amp;P 500 futures rose 7% and gold remained flat. Investors see little reason for further divergence between Bitcoin and traditional markets, especially since the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/was-bitcoin-price-drop-to-75k-the-bottom-data-suggests-btc-to-stocks-decoupling-will-continue" rel="null" target="null" title="null">30-day correlation</a> with the stock market remains high at 83%.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Bitcoin has now surpassed the market capitalization of both silver and Google, making it the world&rsquo;s sixth-largest tradable asset.</p><figure><img alt="Bitcoin price sells off after Trump&rsquo;s US-China tariff deal &mdash; Here is why" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c603-c38d-70ee-9a9e-db32c6816f6d" title="" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>World&rsquo;s largest tradable assets, USD.

With BlackRock and Strategy together holding 1.19 million BTC, about 6% of the circulating supply, some traders worry that Michael Saylor&rsquo;s company is largely responsible for supporting the price.</p><p>Critics, such as Peter Schiff, predict that Strategy&rsquo;s ever-increasing average purchase price could eventually lead to losses and force the company to sell some of its holdings to cover borrowing costs. However, this scenario seems unlikely, as the company has doubled its capital increase limit by $21 billion in stocks and another $21 billion in debt.</p><h2>Bitcoin stalls as macroeconomic events favor stocks over gold</h2><p>While traders often focus on Bitcoin-specific events, the most likely reason for the weakness near $105,000 is broader macroeconomic conditions. Although the pause in tariffs directly benefits the stock market, the effect on scarce assets like Bitcoin is somewhat negative. For example, gold fell 3.4% on May 12 as the demand for safe-haven assets declined.</p><figure><img alt="Bitcoin price sells off after Trump&rsquo;s US-China tariff deal &mdash; Here is why" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c603-c888-76f6-aec9-e6c01bf84e4a" title="" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>Gold/USD (left) vs. DXY US Dollar Index (right).

Lower import duties suggest higher revenues and potentially improved profit margins for companies.</p><p>Given the impressive <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-crypto-etfs-smash-new-record-amid-4-week-inflow-streak" rel="null" target="null" title="null">$2 billion in inflows</a> into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 1 and May 9, the likelihood of a price drop below $100,000 remains low. The steady demand for Bitcoin following a 24% monthly gain points to institutional adoption rather than retail-driven FOMO, which is a very positive sign for the price.</p><p class="post-content__disclaimer" type="">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.
