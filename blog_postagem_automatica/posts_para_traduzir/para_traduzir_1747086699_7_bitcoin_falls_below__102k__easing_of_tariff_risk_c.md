<p>In another addition to the old Wall Street maxim of "buy the rumor, sell the news," bitcoin (BTC) has headed lower after the U.S. and China announced at least a temporary truce in their trade war.</p><p>Bitcoin had been pumping higher since bottoming just under $75,000 in the days following President Trump&#x27;s early April Liberation Day tariff shocker. The price finally again topped $100,000 late last week following an agreement with the UK. China was the gorilla though and BTC nearly reached $106,000 in the early morning hours on Monday after the two countries over the weekend agreed to suspend most tariffs on each other’s goods for 90 days.</p><p>At press time, bitcoin had pulled back to $101,300, lower by 3% over the past 24 hours.</p><h5>Stock markets surge</h5><p>Buy the rumor, sell the news, however, isn&#x27;t applying to U.S. stocks today. Shortly before the close, the Nasdaq is higher by 3.9% and the S&amp;P 500 by 3.1%.</p><p>What gives? No one can know for sure, but bitcoin&#x27;s rally from the April bottom — more than 40% at the peak earlier Monday — had far surpassed that of the major U.S. averages. Given that bitcoin was easily the more extended asset, the sizable relative underperformance today makes a bit more sense.</p><p>"Bitcoin has been the clear outperformer so far, largely because it remains insulated from tariff-related risks," Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, said in a note shared with CoinDesk. "Following the latest Bessent and Greer announcements, I expect altcoins, U.S. equities, and the U.S. dollar, which all underperformed sharply in the first quarter, to begin catching up as the broader risk environment improves."</p><p>Despite today&#x27;s pullback, Kirill Kretov, trading automation expert at CoinPanel, noted that the 90-day tariff pause gave market participants a "clear, short-term positive signal" that&#x27;s supportive for risk assets including crypto, even though headwinds could rise again without a broader deal in place once the pause expires.</p><p>"Lower tariffs ease inflationary pressures and improve global liquidity conditions, both of which are typically bullish for BTC and other cryptocurrencies," he said. "However, keep in mind that this is a temporary arrangement; volatility will likely return as the 90-day window approaches its end."</p>
