The fake announcement, which shook markets in the roughly 24 hours before the regulator actually approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, led to the arrest of Council.</p><p>&ldquo;This case deserves a guidelines range prison sentence,&rdquo; said US prosecutors. &ldquo;Defendant profited through a sophisticated fraud scheme involving fraudulently produced identification documents, a series of misrepresentations at telecommunication stores, and the transmission of password reset codes for victim online accounts to co-conspirators located in the United States and abroad. This conduct deserves a significant penalty.&rdquo;</p><figure><img alt="Law, SEC, Hackers, Court, Crimes, Social Media, Bitcoin ETF" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c671-9761-7d70-becc-c56898cc2632" title="" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>US government&rsquo;s May 12 sentencing recommendation for Eric Council.

With control of the regulator&rsquo;s social media account, the hackers posted a fake message announcing the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC quickly removed the message and announced official approval of the crypto investment vehicles the following day.</p><p>Many in the crypto industry had been anticipating whether the SEC would approve or disapprove of listing spot BTC investment vehicles on US exchanges when the fake X post appeared. The price of Bitcoin surged by more than $1,000 before then-SEC Chair Gary Gensler refuted the false post&rsquo;s claims.</p><h2>DOJ leadership change-up under Trump</h2><p>The Council case and others will be decided under US Attorney picks who have not received confirmation in the Senate.
