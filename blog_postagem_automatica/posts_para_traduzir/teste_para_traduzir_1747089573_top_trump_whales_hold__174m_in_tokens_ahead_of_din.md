Source: TRUMP memecoin project</em></figcaption></figure><p>It&rsquo;s unclear who, if any, of the wallet holders will choose to apply for and attend the dinner with Trump, or the &ldquo;exclusive reception&rdquo; expected to be in the White House for the top 25 holders, on May 22. A May 7 Bloomberg report suggested that the majority of tokenholders were <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-memecoin-dinner-foreign" rel="null" target="null" title="null">based outside of the United States</a>, leading to potential security concerns and conflicts of interest.</p><p>Many US lawmakers and figures in the crypto industry criticized the president for launching the memecoin just days before taking office on Jan. 20. In the wake of his <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/donald-trump-memecoin-holders-dinner" rel="null" target="null" title="null">dinner announcement on April 23</a>, the calls for congressional oversight and allegations of corruption have intensified, with one senator <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-senator-calls-for-trump-impeachment-cites-memecoin-dinner" rel="null" target="null" title="null">calling for Trump&rsquo;s impeachment</a> and other representatives <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/digital-asset-hearing-objection-donald-trump-crypto-corruption" rel="null" target="null" title="null">refusing to consider crypto-related legislation</a> until their concerns were addressed.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/report-advance-knowledge-melania-trump-memecoin" rel="null" target="null" title="https://cointelegraph.com/news/report-advance-knowledge-melania-trump-memecoin"><em><strong>FT report suggests advance knowledge of Melania Trump memecoin launch</strong></em></a></p><p>Companies also apparently seeking influence over Trump&rsquo;s policies have invested in the memecoin. In April, Freight Technologies said it would invest $20 million in the token, suggesting that it could affect the president&rsquo;s trade war between the US and Mexico, where the firm conducts some of its business. As of May 12, the company had not announced whether it qualified to send a representative to the dinner.</p><h2>Not Trump&rsquo;s first appeal to crypto users</h2><p>During his 2024 campaign, Trump hosted a dinner with supporters who purchased his &ldquo;mugshot&rdquo; non-fungible tokens, which featured a picture of the then-presidential candidate at his surrender to authorities on charges he attempted to overturn the 2020 election. </p><p>Many of the &ldquo;mugshot&rdquo; attendees publicly shared their identities on social media ahead of and during the event, but at the time of publication, no one appeared to be claiming they would apply for the memecoin dinner. Wallets with the usernames &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; and &ldquo;elon&rdquo; have led to speculation that Tron founder Justin Sun and Tesla CEO Elon Musk &mdash; both Trump supporters who have financial interests tied to Trump&rsquo;s presidency &mdash; could be among the attendees. </p><p><em><strong>Magazine: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/trumps-crypto-insider-trading-conflict-of-interest-concerns/" rel="null" target="null" title="null"><em><strong>Trump&rsquo;s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions</strong></em></a></p></p>
