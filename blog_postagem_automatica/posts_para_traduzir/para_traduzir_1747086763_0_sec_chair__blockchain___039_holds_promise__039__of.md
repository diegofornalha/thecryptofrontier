Instead, the Commission will utilize its existing rulemaking, interpretive, and exemptive authorities to set fit-for-purpose standards for market participants.&rdquo;</p><figure><img alt="SEC, United States, Tokenization" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c657-f95e-7e14-9afc-7c76280a4122" title="" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: </em><a href="https://x.com/SECGov/status/1922001049595863129" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="https://x.com/SECGov/status/1922001049595863129"><em>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>A key priority will be to &ldquo;develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets while continuing to discourage bad actors from violating the law.&rdquo;</p><p>In particular, Atkins said the SEC would focus on establishing &ldquo;clear and sensible guidelines&rdquo; for crypto assets that could be considered securities. Another area of focus would be to allow brokers to offer a broader range of investment products on their platforms, which in some cases may mix securities and non-securities.</p><p>Atkins&rsquo; approach moves away from former SEC Chair Gary Gensler&rsquo;s, whose tenure was criticized by some industry participants for its <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-enforcement-actions-gary-gensler" rel="null" target="null" title="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-enforcement-actions-gary-gensler">&ldquo;regulation by enforcement&rdquo;</a> method of oversight.</p><h2>Securities evolution</h2><p>Atkins likened the tokenization of securities to the evolution of audio formats &mdash; from vinyl to cassettes to digital software &mdash; highlighting how each shift enhanced compatibility and interoperability across a wide range of devices and applications. This progression eventually gave rise to streaming content business models, which he said &ldquo;greatly benefited consumers and the American economy.&rdquo;</p><figure><img alt="SEC, United States, Tokenization" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c65b-407a-788d-8ea7-2a976f5a484d" title="" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>SEC's Crypto Task Force Roundtable on May 12.

Some asset management firms, like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have already jumped into tokenization through their respective <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrocks-buidl-fund-explained-why-it-matters-for-crypto-and-tradfi" rel="null" target="null" title="null">BUIDL</a> and BENJI tokenized US treasury funds.

Tokenization may also help provide liquidity to asset classes that have historically been illiquid.</p><p><a href="https://app.rwa.xyz/" rel="null" target="null" title="null">According</a> to RWA.xyz, $22.6 billion of real-world assets are onchain, a 7.6% rise in the past 30 days. That doesn&rsquo;t include stablecoins, which are often backed by real-world assets like treasury bills.
