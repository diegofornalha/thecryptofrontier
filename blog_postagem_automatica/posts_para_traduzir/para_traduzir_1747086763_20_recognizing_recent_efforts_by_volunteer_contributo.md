<p>Through continued donations and support from the community, we’re thankful to
have recently been able to send out over $15,000 USD worth of bitcoin as a
gesture of gratitude to people who volunteer to help translate bitcoin.org and
spread the word about Bitcoin. Each month, contributors are helping localize
bitcoin.org so that more people around the world can easily get started and
learn more about Bitcoin in their own languages.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-involved">How to get involved</h2>

<p>Anyone who is fluent in a language that isn’t English can help translate the
site. You can get started by following a few basic steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a free <a href="https://www.transifex.com/signup/">Transifex account</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Browse to the <a href="https://www.transifex.com/bitcoinorg/bitcoinorg/">bitcoin.org translation
project</a>, find the language
you’re fluent in, and join the translation team associated with it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you’re on the team you can start translating. Go to the
“Dashboard” on the top of the page, then to “Languages” and select your
language. You will see a lot of different resources and their progress. Each
resource consists of a number of strings. A string is a “string” of text on
bitcoin.org. The first resource (“bitcoin.org”) contains all strings for the
main site. You can start there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Join the <a href="https://t.me/bitcoinaroundtheworld">Telegram group</a>, feel free to
introduce yourself and let people know if you have questions. :)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="special-acknowledgments">Special acknowledgments</h2>

<p>In addition to the many volunteers, many of the advances and recent progress in
the translation project wouldn’t be possible without the help of Simon
Hinterreiter and Koichi Hendrawan, who help manage and organize the translation
project, as well as the teams.</p>

<p>A special thanks is also owed to Transifex, for providing us with special access
to their platform.</p>

<h2 id="about-bitcoinorg">About bitcoin.org</h2>

<p>Bitcoin.org was originally registered and owned by Satoshi Nakamoto and Martti
Malmi. When Satoshi left the project, he gave ownership of the domain to
additional people, separate from the Bitcoin developers, to spread
responsibility and prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control
over the Bitcoin project. Since then, the site has been developed and
maintained by different members of the Bitcoin community.</p>

<p>Despite being a privately owned site, its code is open-source and there have
been thousands of commits from hundreds of contributors from all over the
world. In addition to this, over a thousand translators have helped to make the
site display natively to visitors in their own languages — now 25 different
languages and growing.</p>

<p>Bitcoin.org receives millions of visitors a year from people all over the world
who want to get started with and learn more about Bitcoin.</p>
