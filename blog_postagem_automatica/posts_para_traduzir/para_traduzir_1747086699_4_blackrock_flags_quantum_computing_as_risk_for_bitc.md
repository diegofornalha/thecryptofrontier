The revised version addressed potential risks to the integrity of the Bitcoin network posed by quantum computing, the filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1980994/000143774925015853/bit20250418_posam.htm" rel="null" target="null" title="null">shows</a>.</p><p>&ldquo;[I]f quantum computing technology is able to advance [&hellip;] it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world&rsquo;s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like bitcoin,&rdquo; BlackRock said. </p><p>It is the first time the asset manager has explicitly flagged this risk in its IBIT disclosures. The IBIT ETF is the largest spot Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price" rel="" target="_self" title="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) ETF, with approximately $64 billion in net assets, according to its website.&nbsp;</p><p>Quantum computing is an emergent field that seeks to use the principles of quantum mechanics to greatly enhance computers&rsquo; processing capabilities.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="BlackRock flags quantum computing as risk for Bitcoin ETFs" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c5b0-a629-74d8-bd0a-37fc4418118a" title="" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>Source: </em><a href="https://x.com/JSeyff/status/1920962621919924347" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="https://x.com/JSeyff/status/1920962621919924347"><em>James Seyffart/Bloomberg Intelligence </em></a></figcaption></figure><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/quantum-computing-bitcoin-lost-wallet-threat-tether-ceo" rel="" target="_self" title="https://cointelegraph.com/news/quantum-computing-bitcoin-lost-wallet-threat-tether-ceo"><em><strong>Quantum computing will bring lost Bitcoin 'back in circulation&rsquo; &mdash; Tether CEO</strong></em></a></p><h2>Record-breaking inflows</h2><p>James Seyffart, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, cautioned that risk disclosures such as IBIT&rsquo;s are required to highlight every possible risk to an asset, even those that are extremely unlikely.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;They are going to highlight any potential thing that can go wrong with any product they list or underlying asset that&rsquo;s being invested in,&rdquo; Seyffart said in a May 9 X post. &ldquo;It's completely standard.
