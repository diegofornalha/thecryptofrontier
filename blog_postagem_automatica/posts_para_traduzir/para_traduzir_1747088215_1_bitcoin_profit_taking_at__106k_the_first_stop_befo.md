Previously, March&rsquo;s CPI, released April 10, was 2.4%, down from February&rsquo;s 2.8%, despite a forecast of 2.5%. April&rsquo;s CPI is forecasted to remain at 2.4%, due to steady energy prices amid balanced oil production and moderating wage growth, easing pressure on price increases.</p><figure><img alt="Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Price, Markets, Price Analysis" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c5a8-7eff-7988-9fad-189faf5adf48" title="" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>US Consumer Price Index data.

Conversely, a higher-than-expected CPI could be bearish, raising inflation fears and strengthening the dollar, pressuring BTC.</p><p>If bearish pressure persists on BTC charts even after the CPI print, an immediate key area of interest remains between $100,500 and $99,700, a fair value gap (FVG) on the four-hour chart. </p><p>Another FVG remains between $98,680 and $97,363, which would represent an 8% correction from the recent highs. </p><figure><img alt="Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Price, Markets, Price Analysis" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-05/0196c5b3-19ad-751e-9773-9e2ca11f0994" title="" /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>Bitcoin 4-hour chart.
